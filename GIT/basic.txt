  - multiple developers will work for project development
  - developers will work from diff machines(laptop)
  example:
  dev1: homepage 
  dev2: payment 
  dev3: product_categories
  - all developers should store the source code at one place [code intergration]
  - to integrate all source code we need a sorce code management tool
    thats why we are using #Github and Git

# Advantages of SCM Tools: 
- all developers can connect to central repo and integrate code
- who modified code
- when code changes happen 
- what changes he did

# SCM Tools:
1. Github
2. GitLab
3. Bit Bucket
-> Github [code intergration]
# create an account on https://github.com 
# create one central repository/remote repository
  - it is used to store code changes
  - every time you create new repository a unique url will be generated
    example: https://github.com/abhipraydhoble/myfirstrepo.git
  - so all the developers will connect to this repo using above url
  - we have 2 types of repos on github:
    1. public repo -> anyone can see this repo
    2. private repo -> only you can see this repo

-> Git [for version control]
- to perform git operation on local machine we required git client 
  -> windows: git bash
  -> linux:  apt install git / yum install git 


# how to connect with central repo

- go to github -> click on repo
-> copy link
1.https: required username and token
2.ssh: no auth required

commands:
# git clone url:.................. 
# git config --global user.name "asdfg"
# git config --global user.email "admin@gmail.com"
# git add filename
# git commit -m "msg"
# git push origin main
